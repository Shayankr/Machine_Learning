Here,TensorFlow is discussed in detail.

TensorFlow is a Python library for fast numerical computing created and released by Google.

Google built the underlying TensorFlow software with the C++ programming language.

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.

TensorFlow is developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications. It also supports traditional machine learning.

Keras is a minimalist Python library for deep learning that
can run on top of Theano or TensorFlow. It was developed to make implementing deep learning models as fast and easy as possible for research and development.
